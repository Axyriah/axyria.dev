            <h1>Spanish Learning</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Recently, as of September 2022, I started learning the Spanish language. It is not a hard task for me,
            since I'm also a speaker of another language that derives from Latin. This article may be updated
            frequently whenever I get knowledge that is worth sharing, and this will be soon available in Portuguese
            as well.</p>
        <p>However, when we are talking about formal pronunciation, Spanish is not that similar to other languages. This
            note will focus on pronunciation tips, assuming that you already have a reasonable amount of knowledge about
            Spanish. To make this easier for non-native English speakers, sounds here have an IPA representation
            alongside its English-like sound.</p>

            <h2>Consonants</h2>
            <p>While I was diving into the <code>/r/brasil</code> subreddit, I found some interesting posts about
                language learning, so I will pretty much explain some things I already knew and some useful information
                I found in that post.
            </p>
            <p>In contrast to English, Spanish's double-l (ll) is a digraph pronounced differently in many countries.
                Generally speaking about Latin American Spanish, it is usually pronounced just like English's
                <code>y</code> (/ʃ/). On the other hand, in Rioplatense-Spanish speaking countries (such as Uruguay and
                Argentina) it is pronounced as English's <code>sh</code> (/ʒ/), while in European Spanish it is
                pronounced as the English's <code>j</code> or <code>ly</code> (/ʎ/).
            </p>
            <p>It is also worth noting that <code>b</code> and <code>v</code> consonant sounds in Spanish are
                identical in all dialects, and a similar situation happens with <code>c</code>, <code>z</code>, and
                <code>s</code> consonants, which are all pronounced just like the English's <code>s</code> (/s/) sound
                in Latin American Spanish, while in European Spanish, <code>c</code> and <code>z</code> are pronounced
                as English's non-voiced <code>th</code> (/θ/) sound, and <code>s</code> is pronounced as English's
                <code>sh</code> (/ʃ/).
