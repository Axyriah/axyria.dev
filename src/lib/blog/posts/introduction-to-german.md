As both English and German share West Germanic roots, they have many similarities in
their vocabulary. However, the grammar is quite different. In this post, I
will be discussing the basics of German grammar and how it differs from English, and
how you could kind of transfer your English knowledge to German.

## Vocabulary

A good starting point would be to learn some basic vocabulary by identifying Germanic
words and their English equivalents. For example, the German word for "house" is
"das Haus", which is very similar to the English word "house". The German word for "to learn"
is "lernen", "to have" is "haben", etc. Unsurprisingly, most of the Germanic words in
modern English consists of one to two syllables, while the Germanic words in German
consists of one to three syllables. This is because English has lost many of its
inflections, while German has retained most of them.

## Conjuctions

In linguistics, a coordinating conjunction is a conjunction that joins two or more
words, phrases, or clauses of equal status. In English, the most common coordinating
conjunctions are "and", "but", and "or". In German, the most common coordinating
conjunctions are "und", "aber", and "oder". As you see, they are very similar to
their English counterparts.

There's no difference in the usage of coordinating conjunctions between English and
German.

In contrast to coordinating conjunctions, subordinating conjunctions are conjunctions
that join two or more clauses of unequal status - one (the subordinate) of which
serves to modify the other or to establish its context. In English, the most common
subordinating conjunctions are "because", "since", "although", "if", "when", "while",
"where", "before", "after", "until", "as", "than", "that", "whether", "though", etc.

An independent clause is a clause that can stand alone as a sentence (i.e., it
expresses a complete thought). A dependent clause is a clause that cannot stand alone
as a sentence (i.e., it does not express a complete thought).

In clauses introduced by subordinating conjunctions, the verb is placed at the end of
the clause, and a comma is placed before the subordinating conjunction. For example,
"because I am hungry" is "weil ich hungrig bin" in German. The verb "bin" is placed at
the end of the clause, and a comma is placed before the subordinating conjunction
"weil". Now, in a complete sentence: "I am hungry because I am hungry" is "Ich bin
hungrig, weil ich hungrig bin" in German.

However, when a double infinitive construction is involved, the conjugated verb form
precedes the two infinitives. The double infinitive always goes to the end of the clause
or sentence. For example: "Ich weiß ncicht, **ob** er **hat** mitkommen wollen" is
"I don't know if he wanted to come along" in English. The verb "hat" is conjugated,
and the two infinitives "mitkommen" and "wollen" are placed at the end of each clause.

When a sentence begins with a subordinating conjunction, the main clause begins with
the conjugated verb in keeping with the V2 rule ("verb at second position"). The
subordinate clause becomes the first position, so the verb of the main clause must
occupy the second position. For example:

Hans wird Sie anrufen, während Sie in Berlin sind.
(Hans will call you while you're in Berlin.) -> **Während** Sie in Berlin sind
, _wird_ Hans Sie anrufen. (While you are in Berlin, Hans will call you.)

(während is a subordinating conjunction, and the subordinating clause occupies the
first position of the sentence, so the second position must be occupied by the verb
of the main clause, wird.)

If there is a separable prefix verb in a dependent clause, the prefix remains attached
to the verb, and the entire verb goes to the end of the clause, whereas normally the
prefix would go to the end.

And when there are two verbs in a dependent clause (such as a modal and an infinitive),
the modal goes last, following the infinitive.

**TIP:** interrogative words can also act as subordinating conjunctions. Also, take
this table of conjuctions as a reference:

| German  | English  |
| ------- | -------- |
| als     | when     |
| bevor   | before   |
| bis     | until    |
| da      | since    |
| damit   | so that  |
| dass    | that     |
| wenn    | if       |
| ob      | whether  |
| obwohl  | although |
| weil    | because  |
| nachdem | after    |
| wie     | how      |
| während | while    |

## Grammar cases and articles

In English, there are three cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive. In German,
there are four cases: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive. The nominative
case is used for the subject of a sentence, the accusative case is used for the
direct object of a sentence, the dative case is used for the indirect object of a
sentence, and the genitive case is used for the possessive of a sentence.

Notwithstanding, the genitive case is rarely used in modern German, and it is
a dying case. In fact, the genitive case is only used in formal writing and
literature. In spoken German, the genitive case is replaced by the dative case.

In English, the genitive case is formed by adding an apostrophe and an "s" to the
noun. For example, "the dog's bone" is "der Knochen des Hundes" in German. As you can
see, in German the noun gender and grammar case are indicated by the article, not
the noun itself. In this case, the noun "Knochen" is masculine, and the article
"des" indicates the genitive case. This table may help you:

| Grammar case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Plural |
| ------------ | --------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| Nominative   | der       | die      | das    | die    |
| Accusative   | den       | die      | das    | die    |
| Dative       | dem       | der      | dem    | den    |
| Genitive     | des       | des      | des    | der    |

Those are the definite articles. The indefinite articles are "ein" (masculine and
neuter) and "eine" (feminine). The indefinite articles are used when the noun is
not specific. For example, "a dog" is "ein Hund" in German. The indefinite articles
are declined in the same way as the definite articles, except for the nominative
masculine and neuter articles. For example, "a dog" is "ein Hund" in German, but
"the dog" is "der Hund" in German.

## Personal pronouns

Just like in English, German verbs are conjugated according to the person and number
of the subject. For example, "I am" is "ich bin" in German, "you are" is "du bist"
in German, "he/she/it is" is "er/sie/es ist" in German, "we are" is "wir sind" in
German, "you are" is "ihr seid" in German, and "they are" is "sie sind" in German,
etc. Those vary dependening on the grammar case:

**Nominative:**

| Person | Singular  | Plural                        |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1st    | ich (I)   | wir (we)                      |
| 2nd    | du (you)  | ihr (you all)                 |
| 3rd    | er/sie/es | sie (informal) / Sie (formal) |

**Accusative:**

| Person | Singular   | Plural                        |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1st    | mich (me)  | uns (us)                      |
| 2nd    | dich (you) | euch (you all)                |
| 3rd    | ihn/sie/es | sie (informal) / Sie (formal) |

**Dative:**

| Person | Singular    | Plural                            |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1st    | mir (me)    | uns (us)                          |
| 2nd    | dir (you)   | euch (you all)                    |
| 3rd    | ihm/ihr/ihm | ihnen (informal) / Ihnen (formal) |

**Genitive:**

| Person | Singular                        | Plural         |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1st    | meiner (mine)                   | unserer (ours) |
| 2nd    | deiner (yours)                  | eurer (yours)  |
| 3rd    | seiner (his/its) / ihrer (hers) | ihrer (theirs) |

## Reflexive pronouns

Reflexive pronouns are pronouns that refer back to the subject of the sentence or
clause. They are used to emphasize the subject of the sentence or clause. In English,
the reflexive pronouns are "myself", "yourself", "himself", "herself", "itself",
"ourselves", "yourselves", and "themselves". In German, the reflexive pronouns are:

| Accusative form | Dative form | Meaning                              |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| mich            | mir         | myself                               |
| dich            | dir         | yourself (familiar)                  |
| sich            | sich        | himself, herself, itself, themselves |
| uns             | uns         | ourselves                            |
| euch            | euch        | yourselves (plural)                  |
| sich            | sich        | themselves/yourself (polite)         |

Unlike personal pronouns and possessives, the polite forms of reflexive pronouns
have no capitalization. The reflexive pronoun usually follows the first verb
in a sentence. For example, "I wash myself" is "Ich wasche mich" in German.
It is also worth noticing that if the subject and verb are swapped round in the
sentence, and the subject is a personal pronoun, then the reflexive pronoun
comes **after** the personal pronoun.

If the sentence is made of up two clauses, the reflexive pronoun comes after the
subject in the second clause. For example, "Ich frage mich, ob sie sich darüber
freuen wird." (I wonder if she’ll be pleased about that.) In this sentence, the
reflexive pronoun "sich" comes after the subject "sie" in the second clause.

Unlike English, reflexive pronouns are also used in German after prepositions when
the pronoun “reflects back” to the subject of the sentence. Another use of reflexive
pronouns in German is with transitive verbs where the action is performed for the
benefit of the subject, as in the English phrase: I bought myself a new top.
The pronoun is not always translated in English:

- Ich hole mir einen Kaffee. I’m going to get (myself) a coffee.
- Sie hat sich eine neue Jacke gekauft. She bought (herself) a new jacket.

In English, pronouns used for emphasis are the same as normal reflexive pronouns,
for example, I did it myself. In German **selbst** or, in informal spoken language,
**selber** are used instead of reflexive pronouns for emphasis. They never change their
form and are always stressed, regardless of their position in the sentence:

Ich **selbst** habe es nicht gelesen, aber … (I haven’t read it myself, but …)

## Verb conjugation

Verbs are conjugated in German to reflect the subject. Regular verbs follow a pattern
of conjugation, whilst irregular verbs do not. That being said, <u>all</u> infinitive
verbs in German end with either "-en" or "-n". For example, "to be" is "sein" in  
German, "to have" is "haben" in German, "to go" is "gehen" in German, etc. Different
verb tenses are formed by changing the stem of the verb or by changing the verb
ending.

Nevertheless, to conjugate a verb in German, you must first identify the verb stem.
The verb stem is the part of the verb that is left when you remove the infinitive
ending, and it is constant throughout the conjugation in most cases. If the verb
isn't irregular, then the verb stem is the infinitive verb without the "-en" or "-n"
ending. For example, the verb stem of "sein" is "sei-", the verb stem of "haben" is
"hab-", and the verb stem of "gehen" is "geh-".

German verb regularity can be either strong (irregular) or weak (regular). Strong
verbs are verbs that change their stem depending on the tense. Weak verbs are verbs
that do not change their stem depending on the tense.

Verbs whose stem ends in -d or -t, like "arbeiten" (to work) or "warten" (to wait),
add an -e before all conjugation endings for pronunciation reasons. For example,
_arbeitet_.

Anyway, here is a table of common endings for regular verbs on each conjugation tense:

| Tense: Person         | Ending |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| Present: 1st singular | -e     |
| Present: 2nd singular | -st    |
| Present: 3rd singular | -t     |
| Present: 1st plural   | -en    |
| Present: 2nd plural   | -t     |
| Present: 3rd plural   | -en    |
| Past: 1st singular    | -te    |
| Past: 2nd singular    | -test  |
| Past: 3rd singular    | -te    |
| Past: 1st plural      | -ten   |
| Past: 2nd plural      | -tet   |
| Past: 3rd plural      | -ten   |

Verbs ending with -eln have an alternate conjugation for the 1st and 3rd person
singular in present tense. Dropping -el from the stem and adding -le instead. For
example: klingeln (to ring) -> ich klingele/klingle

To find the stem of -ern and -eln verbs, drop the final -n. So, for segeln (to sail),
the verb stem would be segel-. For wandern (to hike), it would be wander-.

For future tense, the verb "werden" (to become) is used as an auxiliary verb. The
verb "werden" is conjugated in the present tense, and the main verb is conjugated
in the infinitive form. For example, "I **will** go" is "Ich **werde** gehen" in German.

## Nouns

Nouns are words that name people, places, things, or ideas. In German, nouns are
capitalized, and although German is a highly gendered language, you may infer the gender
of a noun by how it is spelled. As every language, of course, there are exceptions.

The first category is called "masculine". Here are some patterns you'll see in this
category:

1. **Nouns for men, including professions, are mostly masculine:** _der Bruder_
   (the brother), _der Arzt_ (the male doctor).
1. **Nouns with these endings are mostly masculine:** -or, -ling, -ig, -ner, -smus, -er,
   -ich, -ismus, -ist, -ant, and -us. Examples include _der Lehrling_ (the apprentice),
   _der Schaffner_ (the conductor), and _der Zirkus_ (the circus).
1. **The names of seasons, days of the week, months, compass directions, and
   precipitation are masculine:** _der Herbst_ (the autumn), _(der) Juli_ (July),
   _(der) Montag_ (Monday), _der Süden_ (the south), and _der Schnee_ (the snow).
1. **The names of car brands are masculine:** _der Audi_, _der BMW_, and _der Mercedes_.

About two-thirds of one-syllable words are masculine, so If you have to guess about a new,
short word, masculine is a good guess!

The second category is called "feminine". Here are some patterns you'll see in this
category:

1. **Nouns for women, including professions, are mostly feminine:** _die Mutter_
   (the mother), die Ärztin (the female doctor).
1. **Nouns with these endings are mostly feminine:**
   falt, -e, -ie, -ei, -enz, -anz, -heit, -keit, -tät, -ik, -tion, -sion, -schaft,
   -ung, -ur, and -t. Examples include: _die Psychologie_ (the psychology),
   _die Metzgerei_ (the butcher's shop),
1. **Numbers and the names of planes, ships, and trees are mostly feminine:**
   _(die) zwei_ (two), _die Boeing 747_, _die Titanic_, and _die Eiche_ (the oak tree).
1. **Nouns from other languages that have these endings are mostly feminine:**
   -ade, -age, -anz, -enz, -ik, -ion, -tät, and -ur. Examples include _die Schokolade_
   (the chocolate), _die Musik_ (the music), and _die Kultur_ (the culture).
1. **The names of motorcycle brands are feminine:** _die Harley Davidson_, _die Yamaha_,
   and—when talking about motorcycles only!—_die BMW_.

You can guess words that do not fit into neither of the two categories above are
neuter, but there are some patterns you'll see in this category:

1. **Nouns with these endings are mostly neuter:** -chen, -ial, -ium, -lein, -ma, -ment,
   -nis, -o, -tum, and -um.\* Examples include _das Instrument_ (the instrument), _das Auto_
   (the car), _das Ergebnis_ (the result), and _das Museum_ (the museum).
1. **Nouns that are diminutives (words for cute or small things) that end in –chen or
   –lein are mostly neuter:** _das Kaninchen_ (the little rabbit) and _das Brötchen_
   (the little bread/roll).
1. **The names of colors are neuter:** _(das) Rot_ (the red) and _(das) Blau_ (the blue).
1. **The names of metals and almost all of the chemical elements are neuter:**
   _das Messing_ (the brass), _das Aluminium_ (the aluminum), and _das Kupfer_ (the copper).
1. **Most fractions are neuter:** _das Drittel_ (the third) and _das Viertel_ (the fourth).
1. **Nouns that come from verbs and adjectives are neuter:** _das Schreiben_ (the writing)
   and _das Böse_ (the evil).

When it comes to exceptions, German follows the rule: There are plenty of exceptions.
You'll encounter them even among the most common words, so remember to always study new
nouns with their article. Here are some exceptions you'll run into a lot:

| German noun                       | Grammatical gender category        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| _das Mädchen_ (the girl)          | neuter (despite its meaning)       |
| _der Junge_ (the boy)             | masculine (despite ending in _-e_) |
| _das Croissant_ (the croissant)   | neuter (despite ending in _-ant_)  |
| _das Restaurant_ (the restaurant) | neuter (despite ending in _-ant_)  |
| _der Euro_ (the Euro)             | masculine (despite ending in _-o_) |
| _die Avocado_ (the avocado)       | feminine (despite ending in _-o_)  |

**Some words also change their gender depending on their meaning!** _Der Band_
(masculine) means "the hardcover book," while _das Band_ (neuter) means "the tape"!
_Der Lama_ (masculine) means "the Buddhist priest (Dalai Lama)," and _das Lama_
(neuter) means "the llama."

## Word order

In German, the word order is different from English. In English, the word order is
subject-verb-object, while in German, the word order is essentially V2 ("verb at
second position").

To get started, let's revisit how cases and objects works in linguistics! Take these
sentences in English as examples:

1. The woman sings. "The woman" is the subject and "sings" is the verb. "The woman"
   is also a nominative case since we are using a noun or ponoun as the subject.
2. The woman sings a song. "The woman" is the subject, "sings" is the verb, and "a
   song" is the direct object. "A song" is also an accusative case since it is where
   the verb is acting upon.
3. The woman sings her little baby a song. "The woman" is the subject, "sings" is
   the verb, "her little baby" is the indirect object, and "a song" is the direct
   object. "Her little baby" is also a dative case since it is the recipient of the
   direct object.

Given that input, we have <u>three</u> basic patterns:

1. Nominative + Verb
2. Nominative + Verb + Accusative
3. Nominative + Verb + Dative + Accusative

We could also infer basic rules given the input above, since it is also valid in
German:

**Rule #1:** The nominative and verb must be close to each other.

**Rule #2:** The verb must be at the second position in the sentence.

Now, let's take a look at some examples in German:

1. Die Frau singt. "Die Frau" is the subject, "singt" is the verb, and "die Frau" is
   also a nominative case.
2. Die Frau singt ein Lied. "Die Frau" is the subject, "singt" is the verb, "ein Lied"
   is the direct object, and "ein Lied" is also an accusative case.
3. Die Frau singt ihrem kleinen Baby ein Lied. "Die Frau" is the subject, "singt" is
   the verb, "ihrem kleinen Baby" is the indirect object, and "ein Lied" is the direct
   object. "Ihrem kleinen Baby" is also a dative case.

However, German isn't as strict as English when it comes to word order. In German,
the word order is essentially V2 ("verb at second position"). This means that the
verb must be at the second position in the sentence, but the subject can be at any
position in the sentence, and the direct object and indirect object can be at any
position in the sentence as well. For example:

1. Die Frau singt ihrem kleinen Baby ein Lied. "Die Frau" is the subject, "singt" is
   the verb, "ihrem kleinen Baby" is the indirect object, and "ein Lied" is the direct
   object. "Ihrem kleinen Baby" is also a dative case.
1. Ihrem kleinen Baby singt die Frau ein Lied. "Die Frau" is the subject, "singt" is
   the verb, "ihrem kleinen Baby" is the indirect object, and "ein Lied" is the direct
   object. "Ihrem kleinen Baby" is also a dative case.
1. Ein Lied singt die Frau ihrem kleinen Baby. "Die Frau" is the subject, "singt" is
   the verb, "ihrem kleinen Baby" is the indirect object, and "ein Lied" is the direct
   object. "Ihrem kleinen Baby" is also a dative case.

So, how do we know which one is the subject, the direct object, and the indirect
object? Well, we can infer that from the context of the sentence, or by using the
Standard German Sentence Pattern: **Nominative + Verb + Accusative\*/Dative\*/Adverbs\***.
However, when we want to emphasize something, we can move it to the first position
of the sentence. For example: **() + Verb + Nominative + Accusative\*/Dative\*/Adverbs\***,
where the emphasized part is in the parentheses (either an object or an adverb), and
the verb is at the second position. This is called the Transposed Sentence Pattern.

So, taking this sentences as examples of how the Transposed Sentence Pattern works:

1. Ich fliege morgen mit meiner Familie nach Deutschland.
2. Morgen fliege ich mit meiner Familie nach Deutschland.
3. Mit meiner Familie fliege ich morgen nach Deutschland.
4. Nach Deutschland fliege ich morgen mit meiner Familie.
