  <p class="text-secondary width-limited">
    Hi there! My name is Pedro and I am a 15-year-old autistic software engineer
    and theoretical computer science enthusiast based in Brazil. I am passionate
    about compilers, kernels, and lexical analyzers, but my interests don't stop
    there. I also love to delve into other subjects such as functional
    programming, philosophy, linguistics, and physics. Despite being on the
    autism spectrum, I am determined to make a significant impact in my field
    and inspire others to do the same.
